## 📊 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Extraction**:  
   Raw event and user data (e.g., sign-up dates, activity logs, email clicks) were extracted using SQL from a relational database. This included user-level attributes and engagement metrics.

2. **Cohort Analysis**:  
   Customers were grouped into cohorts based on their sign-up month. We tracked how long each cohort remained active over time to identify drop-off points and evaluate user retention behavior.

3. **Engagement Modeling**:  
   Python scripts were used to calculate KPIs like retention rate, reactivation rate, and email click-through rate. These metrics were visualized and benchmarked across cohorts.

4. **Dashboarding**:  
   Tableau dashboards were created to visualize user engagement trends, retention heatmaps, and campaign performance. These were shared with marketing and sales teams to support real-time decision-making.

5. **Optimization**:  
   Based on the trends, targeted re-engagement campaigns were suggested. These optimized follow-up sequences led to a significant boost in user activity and reduced time spent on manual reporting.
